# Getting started

BricksAI provides a RESTful API to manage your proxy secret keys and providers. You can use the API to manage proxy secret keys, manage providers, and fetch usage data programmatically.

## Authorization

To authorize your requests, you need to include your BricksAI secret key in the `Authorization` header. You can find your BricksAI secret key by navigating to the **Settings** page. Under "Developer access", click "Enable". Then you will see your BricksAI secret key.
