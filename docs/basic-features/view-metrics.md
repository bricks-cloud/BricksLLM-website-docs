# View metrics

When you send a request via BricksAI, we track the request and provide you with metrics to help you understand the cost and performance of your requests. You can view these metrics in the BricksAI dashboard.

## View metrics for the entire organization

To view metrics for the entire organization, navigate to the **Dashboard** tab in the BricksAI dashboard.

## View metrics for a particular secret key

To view metrics for a particular secret key, navigate to the **Secret keys** tab in the BricksAI dashboard, then click on the secret key you want to view metrics for.

If you don't see the secret key you're looking for, it might be because the secret key was created by a different user. In this case, ask the user to add you as a viewer for the secret key.
